# Bio_Analysis
In this project, we have 3 type of datasets: __RNA-seq__, __scRNA-seq__ and __scATAC-seq__.

## RNA-seq
In this part, there are two scripts: __RNA-seq.R__ and __Diff.R__  
In the script in __RNA-seq.R__, you can see that  how I analyse the data for __GO enrichment__ and __different expression genes__.  
In the script in __Diff.R__, you can see that how I compare the result of __Gfold__ and __DESeq2__.

## scRNA-seq
In this part, you can see that __Seurat__ can analyse the data for __clustering__, __finding marker genes__ and __inferring the trajectory of development__.

## scATAC-seq
In this part, there are two scripts: __scATAC-seq.R__ and __CHIPseeker.R__  
In the script in __scATAC-seq.R__, you can see that __SnapATAC__ can analyse the data for __clustering__, __peak calling__ and __annotating___.  
In the script in __CHIPseeker.R__, you can see the __annotating for peak calling__, __analysing the proportion of gene types__.
