# Bio_Analysis
In this project, we have 3 type of datasets: RNA-seq, scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq.

## RNA-seq
In this part, there are two scripts: RNA-seq.R and Diff.R  
In the script in RNA-seq.R, you can see that  how I analyse the data for GO enrichment and different expression genes.
In the script in Diff.R, you can see that how I compare the result of Gfold and DESeq2.

## scRNA-seq
In this part, you can see that Seurat can analyse the data for clustering, finding marker genes and inferring the trajectory of development.

## scATAC-seq
In this part, there are two scripts: scATAC-seq.R and CHIPseeker.R
In the script in scATAC-seq.R, you can see that SnapATAC can analyse the data for clustering, peak calling and annotating.
In the script in CHIPseeker.R, you can see the annotating for peak calling, analysing the proportion of gene types.
